3 Main Questions
● Which conference has the highest average offensive efficiency from 2013-2019(Comparison)
● Is there a correlation between the adjusted tempo and the amount of wins per season for
teams in the Big Ten Conference? (Correlation)
● How has the three point percentage of all D1 teams in the NCAA changed over time?(Change)
3) Types of Graphs and correlations
For the first question, we will gather the number of points scored by each team in every
conference, and graph the total points per conference on a bar graph. To answer the
second question, we will gather the adjusted tempo and amount of wins stat per year for
every Big 10 conference team and plot them on a scatter plot. The final question will
accumulate the average three point percentage of all D1 teams in the NCAA every year
and compare them in a bar graph over the years
