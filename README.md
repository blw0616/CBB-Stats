Types of Graphs and correlations-  
For the first question, we will gather the number of points scored by each team in every
conference, and graph the total points per conference on a bar graph. To answer the
second question, we will gather the adjusted tempo and amount of wins stat per year for
every Big 10 conference team and plot them on a scatter plot. The final question will
accumulate the average three point percentage of all D1 teams in the NCAA every year
and compare them in a bar graph over the years
